        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the pizza sauce, melt the butter in a small saucepan and add the onion, salt, red pepper flakes, and oregano, and sauté until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, sugar, and crushed tomatoes, and simmer for roughly 20 minutes or until sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>For the dough, combine the active dry yeast, sugar, and warm water together and let sit for one minute.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the yeast mixture and butter into the dry ingredients and stir until dough forms.</li>
            <li>Bring dough to floured surface and knead until dough forms into a ball.</li>
            <li>Move dough to large bowl drizzled with olive oil. Coat dough in oil and cover. Let rest for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove dough and bring onto floured surface.</li>
            <li>Cut dough in half and begin working dough out, ensuring that it is at least 2 inches (5 cm) wider than your deep dish pan.</li>
            <li>Double wrap the remaining dough with plastic wrap and place in a resealable freezer bag. Freeze for up to a month.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F (215°C).</li>
            <li>Bring your dough into your oiled and floured deep dish pan.</li>
            <li>Using your hands press dough into sides of your dish making it as even as possible.</li>
            <li>Lay slices of mozzarella across the dough, covering the entire bottom.</li>
            <li>Add pieces of uncased italian sausage on top of the mozzarella and top with tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes or until crust starts to lightly brown and the cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Garnish with parmesan, cut and serve.</li>
